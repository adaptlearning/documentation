**Number of test cases:** 1  

1 - Course default extensions
-----------------------------

Test that extensions can be enabled on courses by default.
Requires an Super or Tenant admin user.

### Test steps

1.  Navigate to "Plugin management". Click Extensions.
2.  Under the "Add to new courses by default?" header, ensure all boxes are unticked.
3.  Create a new course. Enter the course.
4.  Click Manage extensions. Check that no extensions are added.
5.  Return back to "Extensions" within "Plugin management".
6.  Under the "Add to new..." header, tick the box for some plugins.
7.  Create a new course. Check that the extensions that were ticked in step (6) have been added.
8.  Return back to "Extensions" within "Plugin management".
9.  Under the "Add to new..." header, untick the box for a few of the selected plugins.
10.  Create a new course. Check that only the ticked extensions have been added.

### Expected result

*   Admin level users can choose which extensions that shall be added to newly created courses.
  * This does not apply to copied courses that are missing default components.
