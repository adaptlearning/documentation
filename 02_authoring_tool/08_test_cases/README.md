# Test cases

This directory contains test cases for the adapt authoring tool. Before a release, a run-through of these test cases should be completed.

## How to use

Tests are organised into suites, a suite should cover a particular area or feature and can be found in the test suites directory. 

Whenever we have a release we should have a test run, one checklist should exist per run and these can be found in the test runs directory. A test run checklist should contain a list of all the tests alongside the name of the person that carried out the test.

These tests should be updated whenever new features are added.
